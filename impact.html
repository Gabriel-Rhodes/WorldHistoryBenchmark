      <p id="description-text">Wealth Inequality affects a lot when it comes to power, who has it, and how people can get it. When wealth inequality is high, the richest people hold much more power than when wealth inequality is low. If 10 people own half of everything while 990 own the other half, each person in the top 1% would have as much wealth as 99 people combined. Meanwhile if we change it to where 10 people only own a quarter of everything, they now only have as much wealth as 45 people. This margin is still high, but now the 990 have more power than the 10. In the real world a similar dynamic plays out. The larger the inequality, the more the top is benefitted while the bottom suffers. <br></br>Wealth inequality also affects how people gain power. Say, for example, you wanted to become the richest (or in this analogy, most powerful) person you can possibly be. If you start in the richest group of people, your path is very simple compared to someone in the bottom 90%. However, what if on top of being in the 1%, the 1% has half of all wealth instead of simply a quarter. Gaining power is simple in that case since there is more to go around in your 1% group. However, if the 1% only had say a quarter, not only is it harder for the 1% to gain a lot of power quickly, now the 1% has to worry about people in the other 99% catching up since there is now more to go around in that group. While an imperfect analogy, it does show how wealth inequality plays a role in how much power or wealth one can gain. <br></br>How has wealth inequality directly affected the U.S.? Well, while many individuals in the bottom 10% live at best paycheck to paycheck, the top 1% has trillions in wealth. Simply saying trillions doesn't do the fact enough justice though. Imagine you work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, your entire life, never paying a penny for anything. You live for 100 years and make $15 an hour (highest minimum wage in the U.S.). How many lifespans would it take to reach a trillion dollars (which, by the way, the richest person in the U.S. has almost one fifth of.)? It would take 320513 lifespans. To put that number itself in perspective, you would need ~10 years to make that much under the same circumstances. So how does wealth inequality affect people in the U.S.? It has the ability to limit social mobility(how easy or difficult it is to move up the wealth classes in a society, while also simply determining how much power certain groups of people have. <br></br>As is sadly often the case when talking about money-related topics, race also plays a role in wealth inequality. Not only are people of color more likely to be in the 99% instead of the 1%, people of color average around a ninth of the income of white people. This greatly reduces the ceiling for wealth in communities of color, as well as reducing how much people of color start with. In the end, wealth inequality has large effects across the board, but it particularly harms communities of color more often than white communities.</p>
