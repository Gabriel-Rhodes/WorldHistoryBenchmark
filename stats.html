      <p id="description-text">We start in the year 1920. Currently, the wealthiest 1% own around 35% of the wealth. We enter the Roaring Twenties, where wealth is growing in the United States. The U.S. starts gaining wealth in that period with the ending of wartime and transition into a period of prosperity. However, over the next 10 years, the wealthiest 1% gain a larger portion of the wealth very rapidly due to much increased spending benefitting the sellers.<br></br>&emsp;&emsp;We are now in the month of October, the year being 1929. The worst economic downturn in history is soon upon us. Yet, the wealthiest 1% have over half of the wealth in the United States! The top .5% alone make up around 43% of the wealth in the U.S. The Great Depression begins and millions are left in poverty.<br></br>&emsp;&emsp;Over the next 10 years, the Great Depression kills the livelihoods of millions while the portion of the wealth owned by the top 1% is reduced to around 40%. WWII begins and the percentage of the wealth owned by the top 1% reduces by around 6% in the first 3 years of the war, the sharpest reduction of the portion of wealth owned by the top 1%.<br></br>&emsp;&emsp;WWII ends and the top 1% own around 35% of the wealth. We enter the Golden Age of Capitalism. Wealth in the U.S. doubles across the economic board over the next 30 years. The top 1% now only owns around 25% of the wealth. The United States lives in a time of great prosperity and enjoys a lot of economic growth for nearly every individual.<br></br>&emsp;&emsp;The 70’s ended with the top 1% owning around 25% of the wealth. In the 1980’s, the top 1% 's portion of the wealth stopped having a general trend of declining and started to subtly increase over the next 10 years. We get to 1990 and the top 1% owns around 28% of the wealth.<br></br>&emsp;&emsp;The 90’s see an increase in the rate that the top 1% is gaining its portion of the national wealth. In 2000, the top 1% now own 35% of the wealth instead of the 28% that they entered 1990 with. From 2000 - 2002 there is a reduction of the top 1% ‘s portion of the wealth (around 3%), but over the 2000’s the top 1% manage to own around 42% of the wealth in the U.S., a figure not seen since the Great Depression when it was nearing its end.<br></br>&emsp;&emsp;Fast forward to 2021, and the most recent figure on how much the richest 1% has is around 38.5%.
